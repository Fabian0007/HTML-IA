# 🏆 AI-Assisted Production Workflow Challenge

## 🎯 Objective

Build and optimize a production-ready landing page using HTML and AI as a professional copilot.

This challenge evaluates:

- Technical HTML knowledge
- Semantic structure and accessibility
- Form validation techniques
- Multimedia embedding best practices
- Lighthouse optimization
- Strategic and critical use of AI tools

---

# 📌 Challenge Overview

Each participant must:

1. Generate an initial landing page using AI.
2. Improve it using professional HTML best practices.
3. Optimize it using Lighthouse.
4. Document how AI was used.
5. Reflect on decisions and improvements.

---

# 🌍 Mandatory Topic Selection

You must choose **one** of the following themes:

- **AI Internship**
- **Cybersecurity Bootcamp**
- **Data Engineering Program**

The topic must remain consistent throughout your landing page.

---

# 🧩 Phase 1 — AI-Generated Base (Initial Version)

## Requirements

Using AI, generate a basic HTML landing page that includes:

- Proper HTML document structure
- `<head>` with title and viewport
- Hero section
- At least **two content sections**
- A registration form
- One image
- One video

⚠️ Only plain HTML is allowed (no frameworks, no CSS libraries, no JavaScript frameworks).

## Deliverables

- Initial HTML file
- Screenshot of the prompt used to generate it

---

# 🔧 Phase 2 — Professional Improvement

You must refine and improve the generated landing page applying what was learned in the workshop.

## Improvements must include:

- Correct semantic structure (header, nav, main, section, footer)
- Proper landmark usage (only one `<main>`)
- Correct heading hierarchy
- Valid and accessible form labels
- Proper input types and validation attributes
- Meaningful alt text for images
- Width and height attributes for images
- Video with controls and captions track
- Correct viewport configuration
- Meta description
- Language attribute in `<html>`

Run Lighthouse **before and after** your improvements.

## Deliverables

- Lighthouse score (initial)
- Lighthouse score (final)
- List of improvements applied

---

# 🤖 Phase 3 — Strategic Use of AI

Document how you used AI during the process.

## Include:

- At least **3 prompts** you used
- One suggestion you accepted and why
- One suggestion you rejected and why

We are evaluating critical thinking, not blind acceptance.

---

# 🧠 Phase 4 — Reflection

Answer the following:

1. What improvement had the highest impact?
2. What issue did you initially overlook?
3. What does Lighthouse NOT measure?
4. What did you learn about using AI in development?

---

# 📊 Evaluation Criteria (100 Points)

| Category | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Lighthouse Improvement | 30 |
| Technical HTML Quality | 30 |
| Strategic Use of AI | 20 |
| Reflection & Professional Reasoning | 20 |

---

# 🚫 Rules

- Only HTML modifications are allowed.
- You may not remove functional content to artificially improve scores.
- No frameworks or external libraries.
- All improvements must be explainable.

---

# 🧠 Key Principle

Lighthouse provides metrics.

Professional engineers provide judgment.

The goal is not just to reach 100 —  
the goal is to demonstrate structured thinking, accessibility awareness, and production-level reasoning.
